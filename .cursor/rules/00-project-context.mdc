# Project Context Loader

**At the start of every session, read `.cursor/project.yaml` to understand this project's specific configuration.**

## Required Action

Before making any code changes, load the project context:

```
Read: .cursor/project.yaml
```

This file contains:
- Project identity and type
- Tech stack details
- Directory structure
- Naming conventions
- Team preferences
- Custom notes and context

## How to Use Project Context

When the project.yaml is loaded, adapt your behavior:

| Context Field | How It Affects Responses |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `stack.framework` | Use framework-specific patterns and APIs |
| `stack.styling` | Generate styles in the specified format |
| `conventions.components` | Name components in the specified case |
| `conventions.state_management` | Use the specified state solution |
| `directories.*` | Place files in the correct locations |
| `preferences.test_framework` | Write tests for the specified framework |
| `preferences.commit_style` | Format commit messages accordingly |
| `notes` | Follow any custom project guidance |

## Example Usage

When asked to create a component, check project.yaml and apply:

```typescript
// If conventions.components = "PascalCase" and stack.styling = "Tailwind"
// Create: src/components/UserProfile.tsx with Tailwind classes

// If conventions.components = "kebab-case" and stack.styling = "SCSS"  
// Create: src/components/user-profile/user-profile.tsx with .module.scss
```

## When project.yaml is Missing

If `.cursor/project.yaml` doesn't exist, ask:

> "I don't see a project context file. Would you like me to create `.cursor/project.yaml` with your project's configuration? This helps me give more accurate, project-specific responses."

Then gather:
1. What framework/stack are you using?
2. What are your naming conventions?
3. Any specific patterns I should follow?

## Quick Reference

| Project Type | Key Considerations |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `web-app` | SSR/CSR, routing, state management |
| `api` | REST/GraphQL, validation, auth middleware |
| `cli` | Args parsing, stdout/stderr, exit codes |
| `library` | Exports, bundling, peer dependencies |
| `monorepo` | Workspace structure, shared packages |
